# =========================

# --- Chain mode ---
# strict_chain = only in the exact order; if proxy down -> fail (safer, predictable)
strict_chain
# dynamic_chain   # (not recommended for "maximum strictness")
# random_chain    # (not recommended)

# Optional: keep chain length explicit (works mainly with random_chain)
# chain_len = 1

# --- DNS ---
# Make DNS requests go through the proxy (prevents DNS leak for many apps)
proxy_dns

# proxychains uses a "fake" subnet for remote DNS mapping.
# Default is usually 224.0.0.0/4; keep it unless you know why changing.
remote_dns_subnet 224

# --- Timeouts (ms) ---
tcp_connect_time_out 15000
tcp_read_time_out    45000

# --- Noise ---
# Disable this if you want to see proxychains logs per-connection
#quiet_mode

# --- IMPORTANT: do NOT whitelist local networks if you want "maximum coverage"
# localnet 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
# localnet 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0

# --- Proxy list ---
